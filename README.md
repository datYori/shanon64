# shanon64

## TO DO

- ~~encode / decode to base64 x times > decode(x, string) / encode(x, string)~~
- ~~implement shanon entropy calc~~
- ~~for a given starting string plot the evolution of shanon entropy function of number of times encoded~~
- plot multiple results at once , labeled with starting str
